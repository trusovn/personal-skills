# Foundation Readiness Review

Perform a clean-context review of the project foundation.

The question is:

> Can another capable coding agent enter this repository now and plan/implement the product without
> rediscovering the environment or relying on this conversation?

This review evaluates the **engineering substrate**, not product completeness.

## Inputs

Read:

- `docs/project-charter.md`
- `docs/foundation-plan.md`
- repo-local `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md`
- project/architecture map
- relevant ADRs
- build/package/CI configuration
- `docs/ai-foundation.md` when present

Inspect the actual repo state and git diff/status.

## Output

Create:

- `docs/foundation-review.md`

Verdict:

- `READY`
- `READY_WITH_NOTES`
- `BLOCKED`

Also emit one delivery-route recommendation:

- `PERSONAL_FLOW`
- `SDD_QUICK`
- `SDD_STANDARD`
- `SDD_FULL`

## Protocol

### 1. Assume zero conversation memory

Do not rely on prior chat decisions unless they are persisted in the repo.

Try to determine from the repo alone:

1. what the project is
2. what the current scaffold already provides
3. how to install/bootstrap it
4. how to run it
5. how to run the narrowest meaningful check
6. how to run the normal/full verification gate
7. where new product code/tests/tools/docs belong
8. what must not be modified
9. where architecture decisions and constraints live
10. how to diagnose a failed run/test

For an AI-heavy project also determine:

11. where provider/model calls are isolated
12. how tests substitute deterministic model output
13. where output validation occurs
14. how model-dependent quality is evaluated, if required
15. what trace/log data exists for AI failures

### 2. Execute the documented commands

Actually run the commands that foundation claims are canonical, subject to project safety constraints.

At minimum, where applicable:

- bootstrap/install sanity
- build/typecheck
- focused or smoke test
- normal/full test/verify
- lint/static check
- run/boot smoke
- migration apply/revert smoke
- AI boundary fake/fixture test
- eval smoke if an eval runner is claimed

A documented command that does not work is a blocker until corrected or explicitly marked unavailable with a valid reason.

### 3. Check agent legibility

Fail or note problems when:

- the only way to know a command is to infer it from package files
- two docs disagree on canonical commands
- `AGENTS.md` is a long duplicate of architecture docs instead of a router
- placement rules are absent where the repo has multiple plausible homes
- generated/editable files are not distinguished
- important constraints exist only in ephemeral chat/history
- architecture maps contain guessed or stale claims
- foundation created empty/unused abstractions that increase search space

### 4. Check verification quality

Foundation verification should be:

- executable
- local where practical
- deterministic for deterministic behavior
- narrow enough for fast iteration
- broad enough to catch structural breakage before handoff

Do not require heavyweight infrastructure merely to improve a checklist score.

### 5. Check AI foundation when applicable

Block on material issues such as:

- domain/business code coupled directly to provider SDK with no test seam
- raw model output used for side effects without validation
- ordinary tests requiring a live model/provider
- retries capable of duplicating side effects with no idempotency semantics
- no way to distinguish provider failure from parse/validation failure

Do not block merely because a prompt, model, or final eval dataset has not yet been designed;
those may properly belong to feature design.

### 6. Determine the cheapest safe delivery route

Use `references/delivery-routing.md`.

Default to `PERSONAL_FLOW`.

Escalate only when the cost buys real risk reduction.

### 7. Write the review

Use `templates/foundation-review.md`.

Every blocker must include:

- evidence
- why it blocks downstream work
- smallest repair
- verification after repair

Do not generate speculative improvements.

## Definition of Done

- Canonical commands were actually exercised where feasible.
- Another agent can navigate the repo from persisted artifacts.
- Foundation docs and real repo state agree.
- Any AI boundary is independently testable without a live model for deterministic cases.
- Blockers are concrete and minimal.
- A next delivery route is recommended with explicit reasons.
- No product feature review or detailed task planning was performed.

## Anti-patterns

- Rating the foundation by document count.
- Recommending full SDD simply because the project is important.
- Treating every uncertainty as a blocker.
- Running expensive full integration checks when a documented external dependency makes them impossible.
- Turning the readiness review into a product architecture review.
- Using `SDD_FULL` as a prestige/default choice.
